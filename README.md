Application Title: Soccer-Tracker
The application can be used to track teams and their players or 
it can be used by fans to create what they want their favourite team to look like. Users can update the players if the player changes position or leaves the team. Users can delete the player. Users can read information about each team and they can create a team.

Next Steps: Styling will be the first thing I update the project with since we was limited on time to finish. I would also like to add a Champions League Live Scores API to track the results, scorers, lineups, and events of the teams playing in the UCL.
